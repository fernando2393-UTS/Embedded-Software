UTS Embedded Software course projects.

Here it can be found 5 different folders in which different features are applied to a Kinetis microcontroller in a cummulative way.

The final project consists of the implementation of a Voltage Regulating Relay, which was able to modulate the voltage in a voltage generator by performing different measurements of its signal, in a direct and inverse way, as well as more calculations.
